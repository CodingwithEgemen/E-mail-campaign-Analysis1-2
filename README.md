## Campaign Ready Output

In the continuation of this project, the previously cleaned email campaign dataset
was further prepared to be **directly usable by the Sales team** for an outbound campaign.

Rather than repeating data cleaning steps, the focus of this phase was on
**operational readiness and quality validation**.

---

### Key Actions
- A final campaign-ready sheet (**Campaign_List**) was created from the cleaned dataset
- Existing name and company formatting was validated instead of redundantly transformed
- All personal email domains (gmail, yahoo, hotmail) were rechecked and confirmed removed
- Email delivery status visibility was preserved using conditional formatting

---

### Business Perspective
This step bridges the gap between data preparation and real-world sales execution.
The final output is structured to be uploaded directly into a CRM or sales automation tool
without additional manual adjustments.

---

### Outcome
- Sales-ready email list
- No personal email contamination
- Clear visual indicators for email deliverability
- Clean and minimal dataset focused on business use
